An analysis of player data from FIFA 21, taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring/code). Chosen for being a rather messy, raw dataset, affording me the chance to practice pre-processing and visualisation using tools such as Python Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and others.

## Preprocessing

- Dropping and renaming columns as appropriate

- Dealing with datatypes

- Stripping formatting and weight/height markers

- Converting monetary values consistently

- Deriving new columns from existing data


## Analysis

- Scatter plots

- Box plots

- Outlier detection and removal

- 3Daxes plots

- Heatmaps

- Contour Plots


### Further Planned Work

- Analysis of player peak performance


### File Descriptions

FIFA_raw_data.csv - Raw csv data before preprocessing

fifa_db - preprocessed data exported to .csv format

FIFA.ipynb - Initial runthrough of processing the raw data

FIFA2.ipynb - Consolidated and expanding upon the initial processing

 - The above notebooks were running slow due to cell output (a cause I did not understand at the time), so they are redundant, but have been kept due to including some of my thought process and note-taking etc.

FIFA_Preprocessed - Preprocessed data with exploratory analysis included
